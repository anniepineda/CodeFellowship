//Lab 18:
//    Ensure that users can’t perform SQL injection or HTML injection with their posts.
//        Allow users to follow other users. Following a user means that their posts show up in the logged-in user’s feed, where they can see what all of their followed users have posted recently.
//        Ensure there is some way (like a users index page) that a user can discover other users on the service.
//        On a user profile page that does NOT belong to the currently logged-in user, display a “Follow” button. When a user clicks that follow button, the logged-in user is now following the viewed-profile-page user.
//        note: this will require a self-join on ApplicationUsers.
//        A user can visit a url (like /feed) to view all of the posts from the users that they follow.
//        Each post should have a link to the user profile of the user who wrote the post.
